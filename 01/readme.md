## Day 

Nice, I like this first task. Didnt have time to try and come up with any fancy solution, just went with first that came to mind

### Part 1
Decided to start from each end of the strings instead of temporarily saving numbers while iterating through. Also instead of doing anything weird I'm just trying to convert it to a number and if that works then I store it for later. I don't store the converted number yet because need to add it with the 2nd number later.

### Part 2
Expanded on part 1 but made a map and instead and will check for a number-word on each iteration instead of just trying to convert a number. Also had to check if I have the available letters left to avoid nullpointers
